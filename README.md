During the development phase, changes in database structure are unavoidable. Developers may have several databases with different structures.

To compare the structure of the database, developers will find it difficult not to use tools specifically designed for that. Developers must record one by one table names, field names, along with the default data type and data. This will take a very long time and be inefficient.

This tool is very useful for comparing two databases both on the same server and on different servers. The difference in database structure will be clearly seen.

The program is made in PHP language. Developers must ensure that the web server has access to the database to be compared.

To enter a server name, port number, username and password is very easy. Users simply enter it in the space provided. For convenience reasons, users can also swap entries.
