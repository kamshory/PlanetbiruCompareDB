During the development phase, changes in database structure are unavoidable. Developers may have several databases with different structures.

To compare the structure of the database, developers will find it difficult not to use tools specifically designed for that. Developers must record one by one table names, field names, along with the default data type and data. This will take a very long time and be inefficient.

This tool is very useful for comparing two databases both on the same server and on different servers. The difference in database structure will be clearly seen.
